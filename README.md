# Weather ETL Proof-of-Concept

*About Project* :
- As part of a predictive modeling project, I have developed a proof-of-concept (POC) for an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to automate the extraction of daily weather forecast and observed weather data. The ETL process focuses on a single station and one data source, gathering actual and forecasted temperatures for Casablanca, Morocco, at noon local time.

## Data Source
- I utilized the weather data package provided by the open-source project [wttr.in](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in), a web service that offers weather forecast information in a text-based format.

This POC serves as a foundation for future enhancements, including additional locations, forecasting sources, update frequencies, and various weather metrics such as wind speed, precipitation, and visibility.
